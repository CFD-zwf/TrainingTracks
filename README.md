# TrainingTracks

The repository contains materials for training tracks dedicated to usage of OpenFOAM platform for various CFD problems.

Next tracks are present in the repository:

* simpleFsi -- development of simple fluid-structure interaction application using OpenFOAM solver **pimpleFoam** and functionObject **forces**. Available OpenFOAM versions: OpenFOAM 3.0.0, OpenFOAM 4.1, OpenFOAM+ 1812, OpenFOAM+ 2112
* freeSurfaceFlows

libAcoustics - OpenFOAM library for Computational Aeroacoustics allowing to calculate noise levels.
